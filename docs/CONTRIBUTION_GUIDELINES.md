# Contribution Guidelines
At Symmetry, every change is done on a separate branch and merged to the main branch through pull-requests. Each new merge to the main branch causes a new app deployment to be created for our users (in our Company repositories, not on this one). Therefore, Symmetry follows a very strict set of contribution guidelines in order to ensure the highest quality of code possible for future developers (ie: whoever's reading this) and to allow for the continuous deployment of the Symmetry App on a daily basis (one upload per pull request).

## Set of Documents you must read before Contributing:
1. [Architecture Violations](./ARCHITECTURE_VIOLATIONS.md)
2. [Code Quality Violations](./CODING_GUIDELINES.md)
3. [App Architecture](./APP_ARCHITECTURE.md)
