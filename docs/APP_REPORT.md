# App Report

### 1. Introduction

Begin your report with a brief introduction outlining what your initial feelings with the project where. Mention your experience or personal context to help the reader understand.

### 2. Learning Journey

"Activated focus mode" was activated, and not only in my devices; but it stated the beginning of my process... I knew the time was short, but I could work to make it **enough**.
Then it started: the first flutter-practice app, then the first couple errors, then more flutter, then firebase, mix firebase and flutter, more errors, more **learning**... bloc, cubits, firestore, cloud, consoles, TONS of architecture (achilles tendon).

But the **actual learning**, arrived in the development process. Yes, the momentum was there, and never before had I imagined finding what I found when developing the app. Because facing the **struggle** generates the real learning, and the real experience. Just take a look on mine...

### 3. Challenges Faced

Deep breath taken, brain aimed, first clone, first built, first **error**.
Project dependencies were old, and the flutter version of my machine was installed globally (blame the flutter-practice-app); and when updating-dependencies option forced itself to not be an option, I discovered magic spell FVM (Flutter Version Manager)... just say the words and then you´re done. [Learn the spell here](https://fvm.app/).

Project had old dependencies, which caused a **mess**. And the only option provided by the log (and a LONG research) was migration of the project. So I did it.

Then came the big one. Firebase, backend, architecture, death. Dammn....?
Actually, I utterly enjoyed the architecture implementation (domain, presentation, data). Because finally, I was, at least, **understanding**. It was really fulfilling because we are talking about 3 days.
Biggest struggle with Firebase logic, because I didn´t take the time to **understand** deeply what was I doing.
But the learning will remain there.

### 4. Reflection and Future Directions

There is something called technical debt, it´s like the output you get when you don´t listen the early advices of your grandma; and is something that changed me, obtained specifically from this project.

### 5. Proof of the project

Include screenshots and videos of the final version of your project to visually demonstrate its functionality and design.

### 6. Overdelivery

In this section of the report, you will outline any additional features you implemented or prototypes you created to go beyond the initial project requirements. Follow the instructions below to provide comprehensive documentation for each enhancement:

1. New Features Implemented:

- For each new feature, describe its functionality and purpose briefly.
- If possible, provide a demo or simulation of the feature for evaluation purposes.

2. Prototypes Created:

- Describe each prototype you created and its intended purpose
  - This is to materialize your ideas and help the reviewer understand them but could be a prototype of any type: a UML diagram for the database, a UI prototype, a prototype of a new Architecture, etc.
- Provide links to any code repositories or files associated with the prototype.
- If applicable, include instructions on how to run or test the prototype locally or via a demo environment.

3. How Can You Improve This:

- Reflect on potential areas for further improvement or expansion of the overdelivery section.
- Consider additional features, enhancements, or prototypes that could further demonstrate your commitment to exceeding expectations.
- Provide suggestions or ideas for future enhancements that align with the project's objectives and scope.

By following these instructions, you will effectively showcase your ability to go above and beyond in delivering exceptional results for the Applicant Showcase App. Ensure clarity and detail in your documentation to convey the significance and impact of each additional feature or prototype.

### 7. Extra Sections

If you want to add any extra sections to your report, such as code snippets, diagrams, or metrics demonstrating the impact of your work, include them here.
